###As a player I would like...
1. To keep track of how much money I have so that I don't go broke
2. To choose a computer or human opponent so that I can play with a varied number of people.
3. The option to ask for help so that I can make a better play
4. To choose the amount to bet each hand so that I can manage how much I'm spending
5. For something *fun* to happen when I win so that I'm not staring endlessly into the void for no reason
